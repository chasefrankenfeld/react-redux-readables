# React Redux - Readables (Udacity Course)

*https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter*

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's Redux course.

I have built a content and comment web app. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

This repository includes the code for the backend API Server and the frontend react-redux component. The backend API Server will interact with the front-end portion of the project.

*To run this project

1. Download or fork and clone the starter server repository - https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter
2. Install the requirements from the included package.json file: npm install
3. Run the backend server with "node server"
4. Go into "frontend" folder
5. Install the requirements from the included package.json file: npm install
6. Run the server with "npm start"
